                <p>"Superfreakonomics" is a book written by economists Steven D. Levitt and Stephen J. Dubner as a development to their previous release, "Freakonomics", removing some problematic content and adding new hypothetical situations that the two explore. The book reveals to the reader a side to economics very rarely known to the public; a study of the weird and wonderful statistical anomalies and occurances in our world.</p>

                <p>'Superfreakonomics' teaches the reader key concepts of economics and data science by analysing abstract and interesting topics, such as "WHY SHOULD SUICIDE BOMBERS BUY LIFE INSURANCE?" or "MONKEYS ARE PEOPLE TOO". The former, my favourite chapter in the book, discusses the techniques invented by national security agencies to predetermine potential terrorists before an attack, and the factors that can help catch these criminals. The chapter concludes by providing a profile of the 'statistical terrorist'; a male in his late 20's to early 30's with two or more Muslim names, a mobile phone, renting a home as a student, with no savings account and does not withdraw money money from an ATM on a Friday and of course - most importantly - does not buy life insuance. If you wish to evade capture, statistically, you ought to buy life insurance! However, a so called 'Variable X', a secret, undisclosable factor found by a man under the alias of Sir Ian Horsley, is very likely to catch you regardless. </p>

"The data showed that a would-be terrorist was disproportionately unlikely to:
<br>
- Have a savings account
<br>
- Withdraw money from an ATM on a Friday afternoon
<br>
-Buy life insurance"

                <p>In conclusion, 'Superfreakonomics' is a highly enjoyable and amusing, whilst simultaneously educational, read that will - statistically speaking - fascinate the reader.</p>
